# Conversational-AI-Chatbot-for-the-Elderly-and-Disabled
This project was done as part of Omdena - France chapter.
In this project, our goal is to create a virtual caregiver system that extracts the expression of mental and physical health states through dialogue-based human-computer interaction to support tailored treatment for elderly people and disabled. Natural language processing libraries like Natural Language Toolkit or Microsoft DialoGPT etc. makes it possible to model a conversational AI chatbot capable of assistance with daily living activities, providing advice on managing complex care, providing emotional support, participating in decision-making, and communicating with healthcare providers.
